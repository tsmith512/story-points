        <h2>What they mean &amp; how we use them</h2>
      </header>
      <h3>So you may be thinking:</h3>
      <dl>
        <div>
          <dt>What are Story Points?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Story points rate the <em>complexity</em> of a task, relative to the
              complexity of other tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a class="video" href="https://vimeo.com/206174429">Video explanation!</a>
            </p>
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>So they're hours?</dt>
          <dd>
            Nope! Story points rate <em>complexity</em>, not <em>time</em>. A
            task might take me longer to build than you, but we can probably
            agree that it is more or less complicated than another task.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>Give me an example.</dt>
          <dd>
            I can't tell you how much a motorcycle or a pickup or an airplane
            weighs, but I can tell you that a motorcycle weighs less than an
            airplane, and a pickup is somewhere in the middle.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>How does this help?</dt>
          <dd>
            Over time, a team's average velocity will reveal about how much
            complexity they can build in a given time. This helps predict how
            long a backlog will take to build. Building on the example,
            stakeholders can decide if they want five motorcycles or one
            airplane this sprint.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>Sounds stupid. Why not hours?</dt>
          <dd>
            Estimating is never perfect, but hours have a tendency to vary
            wildly while waiting for follow-up meetings, getting clarifications,
            variance between developers' skills, etc. But over time, a project
            team has a tendency toward a predictable velocity of building
            complexity.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>How do we pick a size?</dt>
          <dd>
            Debate with teammates about how a story might be completed, you
            might know a shortcut and someone else may anticipate a pitfall.
            <strong>Compare against other stories on complexity and approach,</strong>
            not by debating hours. &ldquo;Does this sound as hard as that
            8-pointer from last sprint or does it sound more like a 5-pointer we
            just talked about?&rdquo;
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>How do we standardize?</dt>
          <dd>
            As a company with many teams, if we can all come to a somewhat
            common understanding of rating complexity, estimates become portable
            and our gained business intelligence can be shared across teams.
          </dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt>What about &ldquo;shirt sizes?&rdquo;</dt>
          <dd>
            Nothing wrong with that, but S + L isn't mathematically useful the
            same way 3 + 13 is. Story point values are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and
            20. Your product owner probably translated your shirt sizes into
            these numbers.

      <h3>Here's a guideline:</h3>
      <p class="jira-disclaimer">
        General themes of the kinds of stories we've assigned to point values,
        pulled from Jira. Lacking context makes this difficult to envision
        but if you have any better ideas,

        can be easier than a 3, sometimes we settle on 2. 40 and 100 must be
        broken down, and we often use them for placeholder epics.
